  <h1> Let's study HTML</h1>
  
<p>
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.<br>

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:<br>

Only the content inside the [body] section is displayed in a browser.<br>
  </p>
  
  </ul>

  <li>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: [!DOCTYPE html].</li>

<li>The HTML document itself begins with [html] and ends with [/html].</li>

<li>The visible part of the HTML document is between [body] and [/body].</li>
  <li>HTML headings are defined with the [h1] to [h6] tags.</li>
[h1] defines the most important heading. [h6] defines the least important heading
<li>  HTML paragraphs are defined with the [p] tag </li>
 <li> HTML links are defined with the [a] tag: </li>
  The link's destination is specified in the (href) attribute.<br>
example : [a href="https://www.w3schools.com"]This is a link[/a]<br>
(Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.) <br>
  
<li> HTML images are defined with the [img] tag.</li>

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), (width), and (height) are provided as attributes:<br>
 example : [img src="1.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"] <br>
 
<li>HTML buttons are defined with the [button] tag:</li>
example : [button] Click me [/button] <br>
