  <h1> Let's study HTML</h1>
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.<br>

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:<br>

Only the content inside the [body] section is displayed in a browser.<br><br>
  
  All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: [!DOCTYPE html].<br>

The HTML document itself begins with [html] and ends with [/html].<br>

The visible part of the HTML document is between [body] and [/body].<br>
  HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to [h6] tags.<br>

[h1] defines the most important heading. [h6] defines the least important heading<br><br>
  HTML paragraphs are defined with the [p] tag <br>
  HTML links are defined with the [a] tag: <br>
  The link's destination is specified in the (href) attribute. <br><br>
example : [a href="https://www.w3schools.com"]This is a link[/a]<br><br>
(Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.) <br><br>
  
HTML images are defined with the [img] tag.<br>

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), (width), and (height) are provided as attributes:<br><br>
 example : [img src="1.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"] <br><br>
 
HTML buttons are defined with the [button] tag:<br><br>
example : [button] Click me [/button] <br><br>
  

</body>



</html>
